# Image Captioning using Tranformer

This project focuses on implementing an image captioning system using a transformer-based deep learning model. The goal is to generate descriptive captions for images automatically by leveraging the power of transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project utilizes the Flickr8K dataset, which consists of 8000 images, each paired with multiple human-generated captions.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Flickr8K dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for image captioning tasks. It contains 8000 high-quality images gathered from the Flickr platform, along with corresponding captions provided by human annotators. The dataset serves as the training and evaluation data for the image captioning model. Each image is associated with five different captions, providing diverse textual descriptions for a given visual content.
## Model Architecture
The image captioning system incorporates a combination of transformer-based models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions. The key components of the model architecture are as follows:




## Transformer
The transformer model is employed to capture the relationships and dependencies between the visual and textual information. Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies and have been widely successful in natural language processing tasks. In this project, the transformer architecture is adapted to the image captioning domain, where it attends to the relevant image regions and textual context to generate captions.
## CNN Feature Extractor
To extract meaningful visual features from the input images, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed as a feature extractor. In this project, different CNN architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet are used as alternatives. These CNN models are pretrained on large-scale image classification tasks and can effectively capture high-level visual information.
## Encoder-Decoder Architecture
The image features extracted by the CNN are fed into the transformer encoder, which encodes the visual information. The encoded features are then decoded by the transformer decoder, which generates a sequence of words constituting the caption. The transformer decoder attends to both the visual features and the previously generated words to generate contextually relevant captions.

By combining these different models and leveraging their strengths, the image captioning system aims to generate high-quality captions that accurately describe the content of the input images.
## Usage
To run the image captioning system, follow these steps:

Set up the environment with the required dependencies and libraries. You can refer to the installation instructions in the project documentation.

Download and preprocess the Flickr8K dataset. This involves organizing the image and caption data and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as resizing images, tokenizing captions, and creating data loaders.

Train the image captioning model using the preprocessed dataset. This step involves feeding the image features and captions into the model and optimizing the model parameters using techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation.

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset. This step involves measuring the performance of the model by calculating metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR score, or CIDEr score to assess the quality of the generated captions.

Generate captions for new images using the trained model. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to generate captions for unseen images by feeding the image features into the model and decoding the predicted caption sequence.
## Results
To evaluate the performance of the image captioning system, accuracy can be used as one of the evaluation metrics. Accuracy is calculated as the percentage of generated captions that exactly match the ground truth captions for a given set of images. This metric measures the precision of the model in generating captions that perfectly describe the content of the images.

In addition to accuracy, other evaluation metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR score, and CIDEr score can also be calculated. These metrics assess the quality and similarity of the generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. They provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance by considering not only exact matches but also the semantic and linguistic quality of the generated captions.

The project may provide sample results and evaluations showcasing the accuracy achieved by the image captioning system. These results can be presented in a tabular format, showing the accuracy for different model configurations or datasets.
